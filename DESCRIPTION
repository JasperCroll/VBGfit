Description: This package fits a Von Bertalanffy growth curve with varying asymptotic size on samples with age-size structure data.  The population structure assumes individuals follow a Von Bertalanffy growth curve in which the asymptotic size constant over time or varies between timepoints. The population structure is fitted using a maximum likelihood method.
